## [Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting](https://github.com/ThomasXIONG151215/papers_in_energies/blob/main/ai_sotas/Informer.pdf)
Informer is a long sequence time-series forecasting model based on Transformer:

* It would be benefiial to employ it on industrial cases relying on precise prediction of numerous environment parameters as well as system parameters
* The works presented by this paper is well recognized in the research field of artificial intelligence. In fact it has been rewarded as the outstanding paper during the Thirty-Fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence
* It is worth comparing Informer with the commonly recognized algorithm for regression task such as LSTM and SVR
