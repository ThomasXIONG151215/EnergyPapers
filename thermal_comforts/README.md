It is important to learn about the preconditioning time of heating or cooling of HVAC systems in order to reduce daily load peaks of energy-use. This paper is remarkable as it provides a relatively simple framework: It uses online occupancy data to train an occupancy forecasting model, then a rule-based optimal control approach would decide which would be the AC setpoint temperatures taking also the current indoor temperatures into account.

* The method is convincing and real test applications have been conducted
* The framework is easy to understand and readers have the space to design a more complex version of it according to their own research case
