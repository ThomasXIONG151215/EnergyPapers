With the rise of problems revealed about the excessive load peaks pressionized to public power station. Never before we need demand response solutions as well as regulations that could bring together private energy supplies. To achieve any works related on the term of 'flexibility', the IEA presents the "Energy Flexible Buildings" series to presents their newest works. This paper is worth mentioning because:

* The series provide guidance on relatively fresh concepts in energy flexibility as well as case studies to help the readers better understand their defined terminologies
* Each article of the series are great review of well recognized industrial indicators on energy flexibilities
* The method of simulations are convincing and well described; with the potentials to employ in simulation test bed software on our own
