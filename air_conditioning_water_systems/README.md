# Air-Conditioning Water Systems

To present papers that has been exceptional for the contributors about water systems for HVAC units. Specific topics could go from the reasonable design method of water systems based on white-box type analysis, to machine learning data interpretation of physics effect during the operations.

## [A data driven performance assessment strategy for centralized chiller systems using data mining techniques and domain knowledge](https://github.com/ThomasXIONG151215/papers_in_energies/blob/main/air_conditioning_water_systems/A%20data%20driven%20performance%20assessment%20strategy%20for%20centralized%20chillersystems%20using%20data%20mining%20techniques%20and%20domain%20knowledge%20.pdf)

Description: I believe one of the main strategies for optimising energy systems is what I would call procedures/rules based optimisation. And for me the uploaded paper is a great reference for such approach. It presents a complete data driven performance assessment of a chiller system both quantitatively and qualitatively. The reader could inteprete the methods used in this paper to learn how to better use the energy systems data.
